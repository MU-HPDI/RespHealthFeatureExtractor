# RespFeatureExtractor

## 1 Introduction
RespFeatureExtractor is an open-source python package built to extract features from the processed respiratory signal data. Usually, humans breathe in roughly regular time interval cycles which makes respiration signals simple. Current packages in the market are complex and not apt for extracting simple but quality features from respiratory signals for health monitoring purposes. We are proposing a universal open-source software package to extract features from any type of processed respiratory sensor waveform data.
